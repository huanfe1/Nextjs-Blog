When I'm listening to song or using software, Occasionally some people say:

> How can you listen to this song, the author of this song is a drug addict.
>
> How can you use to this software, the author of this software has made inappropriate remarks.

I want to talk about my point of view, due to the small amount of text to write, So I try to improve my English by writing in English.

My point of view is that in appreciating a work, should separate the author from the work.

When I listen to a song, I don't change my opinion of the work because of the author. All I care about is the rhyme and the lyrics.

The same applies to software. I still use notepad++, I know some of the actions of its author, but I don't give up using it. I use this software for the sole purpose of editing text, the author has nothing to do with me. The only reasons of let me give up using it would be I found a better alternative or my the experience of use was suffer.

I know something about the girl in this picture, she has a lot of bad press. But I still like this picture. This act may seem a little unbelievable to some people. But in my opinion this picture is just the work of this girl. It is not a symbol of this girl, it is just a picture, what does my liking this picture have to do with this girl?

Don't associate the work with its author, liking the work doesn't mean liking the author.
